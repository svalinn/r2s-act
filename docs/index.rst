Welcome to R2S-ACT's documentation!
===================================

A full summary of the workflow is available. The top-level scripts described in the user guide should suffice for most R2S calculations.

Contents:

.. toctree::

   r2s-userguide

   faq

Additionally, the low level scripts all support command-line calls. You can alwas do `scriptname.py -h` for information regarding this, and these capabilities are documented here:
